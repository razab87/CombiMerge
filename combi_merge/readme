CombiMerge is a python plugin for GIMP 3.0 (requires python3). When you have a GIMP session with several layers, CombiMerge merges them together in all possible combinations and exports them as images. To make it work properly, you have to group your image layers in a specific way. For a detailed description of how it works, see the "Usage" section below.

Tested on Linux Mint but should also work on other Linux distros as well as on Windows and macOS. (For Linux users, it might be necessary to use a flatpak install of GIMP to run python plugin properly.)


Installation:

- Download the .zip-file via the green button.
- Extract the .zip and copy the folder combi_merge to your .../GIMP/3.0/plug-ins folder.
- The .zip also contains two example .xfc-files showing how to properly set up a gimp session so that CombiMerge can be applied .


Usage

You need a GIMP session with several groups where each group contains several image layers. CombiMerge then takes one image layer from each group and merges them together and exports. This is done for all possible combinations. For example, your GIMP session might have the following structure:

- GroupA
--- layerA1
--- layerA2
--- layerA3
- GroupB
--- layerB1
--- layerB2
--- layerB3
--- layerB4
- GroupC
--- layerC1
--- layerC2

All image layers must be part of a group. Otherwise the plugin won't work. Also, nested groups are not allowed (i.e. no groups which contain other groups).

When your GIMP session is set up correctly, go to Filter -> CombiMerge. You can then choose the output directory and output format for your images. Click "Ok" to start the process. CombiMerge will then take one layer from each group, merge them together and export the image. This is done for every possible combination so in the above setting, you will get 3*4*2=24 images. The images are stored in a folder called CombiMergeImgs which is created in the chosen output directory.

Naming of the resulting images is done by appending the layer names, separated with a "_". You can enforce specific naming conventions by naming your layers appropriately. In the above example, you will get one image called "layerA1_layerB1_layerC1.png" (in case you choose png when exporting).

Check the two example .xfc-files to see how you have to set up your gimp session and how CombiMerge exactly works. (Fyi example02.xfc shows how you can literally get every combination from an arbitrary set of layers. You just have to set up your group structure in an appropriate way.)

Note that the execution of CombiMerge may take some time since it is a combinatorial process and GIMP's image export can be time-consuming. For example, only 5 groups with 5 layers each will result in 5⁵=3125 images to be exported. On my system, CombiMerge takes around 30 minutes for this task. Still much faster than doing all this by hand. (My system: AMD Ryzen 5 1600, GeForce GTX 1080 6GB, 16GB RAM, SSD hard drive.)

While the process is running, do not change anything in your GIMP session (except for cancelling the process if desired).
